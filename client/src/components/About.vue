    <h1 align="center">Something more about Boring Messenger</h1>
    <p>Web Messenger created for quick and easy communication between people. Like-minded people from all over the world find each other using the Internet and our instant messenger helps them in maintaining communication. You can easily create a chat with any of the users of the site using the global search! Our community is pretty friendly, so treat users the way you want them to treat you. You surely know this saying, don't you? :)</p>
    <p>One of the advantages of our messenger is the absence of restrictions on the number of chat participants, as well as on the number of chats per person, we are not a social network from mail.ru, if you know what I mean. The second good advantage of "Boring Messenger" is that our site is completely SPA.</p>
    <p>And finally, let's talk about what should be in every messenger, but, for some unknown reason, sometimes not implemented. Of course, I'm talking about real-time messaging. Do not worry, in our product it is implemented at 100%! In addition, you can receive notifications about new messages in real-time as well! Isn't it wonderful? To be honest, before we did not want to implement it, but the first testers forced us.</p>
    <p>Whew, not bad, huh? We hope you enjoyed reading it as much as using our product.</p>
